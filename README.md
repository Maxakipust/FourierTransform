This is my implementation of a Fourier Transform. it is extremely slow and is largely based on <a href="http://practicalcryptography.com/miscellaneous/machine-learning/intuitive-guide-discrete-fourier-transform/">this</a> It currently porduces a spectrogram.
My end goal is to create an audio fingerprinting program to identify and match music.
Please let me know if you have any tips or see any bugs.
